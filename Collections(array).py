#Python Collectons

#Array

#   Array is a collection of homogeneous data refered by using common name that has a fixed size(These are also
#   the drawbacks of arrays)

# int marks = new marks[8]

#marks

# marks[0] = 20
# marks[1] = 30
# marks[2] = 40
# marks[3] = 50
# marks[4] = 60
# marks[5] = 70
# marks[6] = 80
# marks[7] = 90


# A remedy to this is using collection

#Collection

#   1. List
#   2. Tuple
#   3. Set
#   4. Dictionary



#   Properties of collection:-
#   1. How to define
#   2. Hetrogenous data is suported or not
#   3. Insertion order is preserve or not(If we enter a list of numbers in a specific order and
#      it output in the same order it is preserved)
#   4. Dupliate values allowed or not
#   5. mutable or immutable
